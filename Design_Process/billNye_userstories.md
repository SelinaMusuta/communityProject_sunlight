DESCRIPTION: Many organizations have bill tracking pages with static information about legislation they care about. Using the data from Open States and OpenCongress, fellows will develop a bill tracker that provides updated and relevant information about the selected bills such as bill name, number, sponsors, status, and summary.

User Stories
=================================================

USER STORY #1 (Staff):
As a sunlight staff member, I want users of our APIs to be able to embed a well displayed layout of API calls to their site so that that bill information is readily accessible to their members or clients. (user story concerning maintenance?)

USER STORY #2 (Staff):
As a community organizer, I want our members to follow the latest status changes to a bill so that we can decide on the best course of action to quickly mobilize support or opposition to that bill.

USER STORY #3 (Staff):
As a community organizer, I want our website to be updated on a recent bill that our state and federal representatives are sponsoring so that we can hold them accountable for promises made during the election cycle.  
USER STORY #4 (Staff):
As the web developer at a non-profit, I want to include a simple, easy to embed bill tracker widget on our website so that our site will be dynamic and thoughtful.
